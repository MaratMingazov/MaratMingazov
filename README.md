### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Marat Mingazov - Java Software Engineer, working on cool opensource tools.

### My projects:
1. [getCountry](https://github.com/MaratMingazovOrg/getCountry) - The simple Kotlin library that transforms String location into Country/Region/City
2. [EntityLocker](https://github.com/MaratMingazov/EntityLocker) - Demonstration of the multithreading mechanism in Java. EntityLocker is a reusable utility class that provides synchronization mechanism similar to row-level DB locking.
